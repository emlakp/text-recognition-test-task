I used EasyOCR together with some image processing techniques which must hopefully improve any OCR systems performance. 

I suspect that the performance I obtained (0.89) is roughly the best one can obtain without fine-tuning anything. For finetuning, quite specific dataset must be produced, namely screenshoots with natural language and code in english and chinese. It must not be too difficult to produce it synthetically, and will boost the performance.
